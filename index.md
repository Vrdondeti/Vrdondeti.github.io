# 👋 Hi, I'm Vema Dondeti

Welcome to my Data Science Portfolio! This site showcases a collection of applied projects exploring real-world problems using modern tools such as generative AI, machine learning, NLP, and data visualization. These projects were developed to sharpen my technical skills and demonstrate my ability to work end-to-end—from data preparation and modeling to visualization and deployment.

## 📂 Featured Projects

### 1. [Interactive AI Math Tutor](https://github.com/Vrdondeti/data-science-projects/tree/main/AI-Math-Tutor-Chatbot)
A fine-tuned ChatGPT Turbo model deployed via Streamlit to help elementary learners with math in a friendly, conversational tone.

### 2. [COVID-19 RAG Question Answering](https://github.com/Vrdondeti/data-science-projects/tree/main/COVID19-RAG-Question-Answering)
A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using LangChain and GPT models to answer COVID-related questions based on Wikipedia data.

### 3. [Customer Churn Prediction](https://github.com/Vrdondeti/data-science-projects/tree/main/customer-churn-prediction)
Predicts telecom customer churn using machine learning models. Includes SMOTE for imbalance handling and EDA to identify churn drivers.

### 4. [Fake News Detection Using NLP](https://github.com/Vrdondeti/data-science-projects/tree/main/Fake-News-Detection-Using-NLP)
Applies NLP preprocessing and supervised learning models to detect fake news articles based on their text content.

### 5. [Childcare Affordability Analysis](https://github.com/Vrdondeti/data-science-projects/tree/main/Childcare-Affordability-Analysis)
Analyzes U.S. childcare costs using NDCP data with Tableau and Python visualizations to show affordability trends and disparities.

### 6. [Healthcare Readmission Analysis](https://github.com/Vrdondeti/data-science-projects/tree/main/Hospital-Readmissions-Analysis)
Investigates the correlation between healthcare readmissions and environmental/demographic factors using SQLite and multi-source data.

### 7. [TSA Complaints Analysis](https://github.com/Vrdondeti/data-science-projects/tree/main/TSA-Complaints-Analysis)
Visualizes TSA complaint trends by state, airport, and category using heatmaps, choropleths, and geo scatter plots from 2015–2024.

### 8. [Weather Lookup App](https://github.com/Vrdondeti/data-science-projects/tree/main/Weather-Lookup-App)
A Streamlit-based app that fetches real-time weather data from OpenWeatherMap API based on city or ZIP input.
