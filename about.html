            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I am a passionate Data Scientist with hands-on experience in applied projects involving AI, machine learning, natural language processing, and data visualization.  
                I enjoy solving real-world problems by building end-to-end data solutions, from data cleaning and modeling to deployment and interpretation.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have worked on diverse projects such as predictive modeling for customer churn, COVID-19 question-answering systems, and fake news detection using NLP.
            </p>
            <p>
                Currently, I am pursuing a Master of Data Science degree to deepen my skills in advanced analytics and AI.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am highly motivated, detail-oriented, and always eager to learn new technologies and methodologies to improve data-driven decision-making.
